4. The plugin will detect it as a migration package and display a One-Click Import button.
5. Click it, and it will automatically do all configurations pre-applied and directs to the Import page.
6. You can just click Import, and run the import.

= Is there a limit to the number of rows i can import? =
No, you can import unlimited rows with this plugin. It can handle even the largest datasets effortlessly. However, very large file imports may depend on your server's PHP settings (like maximum file size or execution time). Please check with your hosting provider for details.

= Can i get sample files for testing the CSV Importer plugin? =
Yes! Download free sample CSV and XML files specifically designed for testing the import functionality with the Ultimate CSV Importer plugin: [Link to Sample CSV and XML Files](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/wordpress-ultimate-csv-importer-csv-sample-files-and-updates.html?utmsource=web&utmcampaign=readme&utmmedium=wporg)

Enable the **"Download Post-Content External Images to Media"** option in the **Manage Media Uploads** section. This allows you to import images from sources like **Google Images**, **Pexels**, and **Dropbox**, downloads them directly into your media library. 
[See the documentation for more details](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/import-images-into-wordpress?utmsource=web&utmcampaign=readme&utmmedium=wporg).

= How can I import images and troubleshoot failures? =

To import images:

* Use a column in your CSV or XML with direct image URLs.
* If you try to import images along with posts, or other post types, make sure to configure the image fields in the mapping section.
* Ensure the URLs are publicly accessible (HTTPS recommended).

[See the documentation for more details](https://www.smackcoders.com/documentation/wp-ultimate-csv-importer-pro/import-images-into-wordpress?utmsource=web&utmcampaign=readme&utmmedium=wporg).

If images fail to import, check:

* File format compatibility (e.g., .jpg, .png)
* Broken or inaccessible URLs
* Upload folder permissions


= Why are posts or products not showing after import? =

Possible causes include:

* **Missing mandatory fields** such as post titles or SKU.
* **Theme or plugin conflicts** blocking visibility.
* **WP_DEBUG** set to true; change it to false in `wp-config.php` before import.

= Why am I seeing alerts like “Please create Upload folder with writable permission” or “File size exceeded post maximum size” when uploading a file in WP Ultimate CSV Importer? =

These alerts usually mean your server setup needs adjustment, for example, either the upload folder is missing, file size limits are too low, or memory is insufficient. To fix this: 

* Create the ultimate-csv-importer folder in wp-content/uploads/ with 755 or 775 permissions.

* Increase upload_max_filesize, post_max_size, and memory_limit in your PHP settings.

This repository contains a simple PHP-based example for a brutalist style
website. The design is intentionally minimalistic with black and white styling
and gradient rollover effects on navigation links.

The main files are located in the `public/` directory:

- `index.php` - Landing page of the site.
- `styles.css` - Stylesheet providing the brutalist look, gradient hover
  effects and a small animation Easter egg.

To deploy, upload the `public/` directory to your web server via FTP. Point your
webroot to this directory or copy the contents to your existing webroot.

Feel free to modify the markup or CSS to suit your needs.
